/**
 *  The <tt>DegreesOfSeparation</tt> class provides a client for finding
 *  the degree of separation between one distinguished individual and
 *  every other individual in a social network.
 *  As an example, if the social network consists of actors in which
 *  two actors are connected by a link if they appeared in the same movie,
 *  and Kevin Bacon is the distinguished individual, then the client
 *  computes the Kevin Bacon number of every actor in the network.
 *  <p>
 *  The running time is proportional to the number of individuals and
 *  connections in the network. If the connections are given implicitly,
 *  as in the movie network example (where every two actors are connected
 *  if they appear in the same movie), the efficiency of the algorithm
 *  is improved by allowing both movie and actor vertices and connecting
 *  each movie to all of the actors that appear in that movie.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation,
 *  see <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/41graph">Section 4.1</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
